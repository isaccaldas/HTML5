        The <aside> tag defines some content aside from the content it is placed in.

        The aside content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.
        
        Tip: The <aside> content is often placed as a sidebar in a document.
        
        Note: The <aside> element does not render as anything special in a browser. However, you can use CSS to style the <aside> element (see example below).
